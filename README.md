## Game Control

When you press the button, something happens in the game. What happens varies depending on the game. There's an explanation at the top of the game screen about what will happen, but since they're all 1-button games, it's best to just try pressing it.

In some games, holding the button down or releasing it might also trigger something.

Pressing a touch panel, clicking a mouse, or pressing a key on the keyboard all count as pressing the button.

## Game Mode

Game modes can be changed using the left and right buttons in the top right corner of the menu screen. Select a game mode and press the 'Play' button in the top left corner of the menu screen to start the game. You can also start by pressing any key on the keyboard (Excluding arrow keys, Page Up/Down keys, Alt, Ctrl keys, etc.).

### Normal, Hard, Expert

Play 5 randomly selected games for 11 seconds each. You succeed if you reach the target score (displayed at the top of the game screen) within 11 seconds, and fail if you run out of time or get a game over.

You'll receive stars for each game you succeed in. The number of stars increases with higher difficulty modes (1.2x for Hard, 1.5x for Expert). A new game is unlocked for every 5 stars collected.

### Endless

Play randomly selected games from those currently unlocked. The game ends when you run out of stars shown in the top left corner of the game screen. You lose one star when you fail a game. You gain one star for every 10 games played.

Playing this mode does not unlock new games.

## Individual Game Settings

Click on a game icon in the center of the menu screen to select it. 'Play' and 'Ban' buttons will appear for that game.

Pressing the 'Play' button allows you to play the selected game without time limits. This is useful for understanding rules of games.

Pressing the 'Ban' button bans that game. Banned games will not appear in Normal, Hard, Expert, or Endless modes. Ban games that don't suit your preferences. You can unban a game by pressing the 'Open' button.

## Other Buttons

### Ban All Games

This bans all games. If you want to play only specific games, use this button to ban all games and then 'Open' the ones you want to play.

### Reset Game

This resets the game unlock status to its initial state (only 11 games unlocked) and resets your stars to 0.
